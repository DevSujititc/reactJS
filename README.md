# React + Vite Sample project

"I made a list of projects using ReactJS, ReactJS with Vite, and the Tailwind & Bootstrap frameworks. These projects might not be perfect because I was still learning ReactJS when I developed them."

This message is about someone who has created a collection of projects using different technologies like ReactJS and frameworks like Tailwind & Bootstrap. They're mentioning that the projects might not be flawless because they were learning ReactJS while working on them.

Here's a list of some small projects:

1. **Password Generator** - It makes an 8-character password with only letters at first, but you can make it longer and add numbers and special characters by checking boxes.
2. **Currency Converter** - I made a currency converter using an API. It helps you change money from one currency to another.
3. **React Router** - I've created a helpful example that demonstrates website navigation using the React Router DOM concept. In this example, I've also implemented the functionality to view parameters, fetch GitHub API data to display profile details, and handle errors during data rendering, loading, or mutations.
4. **React Context** - Take a look at my React Context demo. It demonstrates how login information can move smoothly between different parts of the app.
